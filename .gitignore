# 1. Ensure the directory is removed from your file system (if possible, 
#    or just remove it from tracking if you need to keep the local files)
# If the large folder 'qr' is your virtual environment, it's safe to delete:
# rm -rf qr

# 2. Tell Git to stop tracking the files that were already committed:
git rm -r --cached .

# 3. Re-add everything (Git will respect the new .gitignore rules):
git add .

# 4. Commit the cleaned index and the .gitignore file:
git commit -m "Cleaned repository of dependency files and added .gitignore"
