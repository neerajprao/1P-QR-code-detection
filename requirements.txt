# Core libraries for object detection and machine learning
ultralytics
# Used for downloading the dataset
roboflow
# Used by Roboflow, Ultralytics, and general data handling
PyYAML
# Used for command-line argument parsing and JSON output
argparse # Note: This is usually built-in to Python, but harmless to list if you want to be explicit.
# Used for numerical operations by PyTorch and other libs
numpy
# Used for file path manipulation (Path objects in your scripts)
pathlib # Note: This is built-in to Python 3.4+, but useful for documentation.

# Note: TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV (cv2) are often necessary for inference, 
# and PyTorch is the underlying framework for Ultralytics YOLOv8. 
# Installing 'ultralytics' typically handles most of these dependencies automatically, 
# including torch and torchvision.
